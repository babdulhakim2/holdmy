## Holdmy.xyz - Improving Patient Care in UK public health

This open-source project aims to improve patient experience with GP practices in the UK by leveraging  Twilio and (LLMs).

## Problem Statement

Patients face significant challenges with:

* **Appointment Booking:** Prolonged phone wait times, frequent call drops, and unreliable booking systems.
* **Inefficient Communication:** Unresponsive contact methods, lack of follow-ups, and poor information dissemination.
* **Staff Interactions:** Instances of unhelpful or rude staff behavior, leading to frustration and diminished trust.

These issues result in delayed medical care, exacerbated health conditions, and overall negative patient experiences.

## Project Goals

Holdmy aims to develop a comprehensive solution that:

* Simplifies appointment booking through intelligent automation.
* Enhances communication between patients and GP practices using cutting-edge technologies.
* Provides personalized and efficient patient support using LLMs.
* Improves the overall patient experience by addressing operational inefficiencies.

## Proposed Solution

We plan to create an open-source platform featuring:

* **Smart Appointment Scheduling:** An AI-powered system that handles making calls and waiting on phone calls on behalf of users to avoid waiting times.
* **Automated Communication:** Twilio integration for calls that navigate the phone tree, schedule appointments and callbacks.
